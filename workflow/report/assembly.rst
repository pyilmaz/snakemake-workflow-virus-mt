Assembly of sample {{ snakemake.wildcards.sample }}. 
Reads were assembled with {{ "`metaSPAdes <https://github.com/ablab/spades>`_" if snakemake.params.is_amp else "`Megahit <https://github.com/voutcn/megahit>`_" }}, followed by reference based contig ordering and concatenation with `RaGOO <https://github.com/malonge/RaGOO>`_.
Then, assembly was polished by applying variants with an allele frequency of 100% (called by `Varlociraptor <https://varlociraptor.github.io>`_ at FDR 5%).
